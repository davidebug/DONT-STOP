Welcome to the World Music Run!

Every year the World Music Run is organized, a cooperative discipline in which a player must run and avoid falling, following the rhythm of the music. The Run is set in several stages and locations of the world, each of them characterized by a different music genre. Every Runner is helped by a Creator that places the platforms, through a digital device, on which the Runner should jump. The competition is evaluated by the public who will tell both the Runner and Creator if they are following the music correctly. The public will place some obstacles and bonuses during the Run too depending on how good the competition is going and they will provide new placeable platforms for the Creator.
